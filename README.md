# javascript-ns

This is an opensource project that aims to provide useful wrappers for 
faster development when using Netsuite API v1.0. Some wrappers might seem
longer than original function call which may be an issue to some, but it
may be a reasonable cost in exchange for an organized and standardized API
function groupings through the use of namespaces which targets to increase
code readability since most of the scripting on Netsuite are on a single file.

Feel free to add more wrappers under namespaces provided or make another one
if the functionality requires.
